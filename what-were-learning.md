# What We're Learning

## Workshops and share-out sessions

**Project kickoff workshop - June 27, 2019**

We held a kickoff workshop to introduce City staff to the project and invite contributions into how we define accessibility for City services. The meeting included:

* An overview of the project's context, goals, and timeline
* Lightning talks from City staff in various departments that work to make City services more accessible and usable
* Discussion of common stages in accessibility, which we are using to develop a rubric for assessing services \(and will publish on this site soon\)
* A workshop to understand how residents find, access, and participate in public services, including barriers that residents face to accessing those services
