# Defining “services”

For this project, we define a service as **an exchange of goods, services, or information between a person and the Austin city government**. In our inventory, services:

* Are community facing \(i.e., not business processes or internal systems within the City government\)
* Use a form or application to exchange information 

We are identifying services that the City of Austin's 40+ departments offer across a range of channels \(online, in-person, by mail, phone\) for a variety of users. Examples include:

* Reserving city space
* Requesting a rebate
* Applying for a permit or license
* Adopting an animal
* Volunteering with the city
