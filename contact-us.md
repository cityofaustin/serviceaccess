We’re continually working to understand what accessibility is. Barriers are as diverse as our residents. We’d love to hear more about any barriers that you’ve encountered, or any barrier-busting you’ve done in your own work to make services work better for the people they are intended for.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please email us: **access@austintexas.gov.**

## **Follow our work**

We manage this project in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/cityofaustin/serviceaccess), where you can track what we are focused on and contribute comments and questions.
