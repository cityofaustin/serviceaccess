We’re continually working to expand our understanding of what accessibility is. We recognize that barriers are as diverse as our residents. We’d love to hear more about any barriers that you’ve encountered, or any barrier-busting you’ve done in your own work. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please email us at - **access@austintexas.gov**.
