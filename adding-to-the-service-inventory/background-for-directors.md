# Background for Directors

## Signed memo

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/memo-inventory-city-services-2019.10.22-signed.pdf" caption="CIO memo to Directors" %}

## **Text version**

**TO:** Department Directors

**FROM:** Stephen Elkins, Chief Information Officer

**DATE:** October 22, 2019

**SUBJECT:** Improving the resident experience with City services: Initiative to inventory City services to redesign and bring online

This memo requests Departments’ participation in a CTM initiative to inventory paper-based or manual City services to consider bringing online for an improved experience for Austin residents. This follows on the CTM presentation at the October Department Director meeting.

**Request for Director action**: CTM will be reaching out to public information officers and other staff in your Departments to add to an inventory of public-facing services that we might consider bringing online. We will use this information to identify priority services to redesign and digitize -- in partnership with your Departments. Please support your staff in collecting and sharing this information. 

This initiative is part of the City’s response to the 2017 Online Access to City Services audit, which recommended that CTM identify services to bring online that currently require paper or PDF documents. We are using this inventory to expand internal tools and resources that we can use to improve the experience and accessibility of City services for the Austin community.

**Next steps**: CTM will be reaching out to your staff in October-November to collect information on your public-facing services. You may also consider coordinating this information gathering with your SD23 Strategic Alignment Managers, who are leading a separate but related effort for SD23 planning. We will also share resources and tools available to departments to digitize services and make them easier to use for residents. 

Attachment A provides more information on the Service Access initiative, including: 

* What types of City services we are considering in this inventory
* The information we will collect on services, with help from your departments
* Internal tools and services available to departments to bring services online

Please direct questions about this initiative to Daniel Honker, [access@austintexas.gov](mailto:access@austintexas.gov).

## **ATTACHMENT A: ABOUT THE SERVICE ACCESS INVENTORY**

**Project overview**: CTM is undertaking an initiative to build an inventory of community-facing services that we should consider digitizing and redesigning. This project, following on the 2017 Online Access to City Services audit, will help CTM prioritize investments in internal tools and services to help departments bring their services online and improve the accessibility and usability of their services for the Austin community. 

CTM’s Service Access project will:

* Build an inventory of paper-based and manual City services
* Produce recommendations on priority services to redesign and bring online
* Share information on existing tools and resources that departments can use to digitize and make their services more accessible
* Develop a strategy for digitizing and automating services citywide

**What is considered a “service” for this inventory**: For this inventory, CTM aims to collect information on services that meet these criteria:

1. **Transactional**: the service involves the exchange of goods, services, or information between a community member and the City government
2. **Form-based**: the service collects information through a template or application, such as those currently based on paper or PDF. 
3. **Community-facing**: the service involves direct interaction with community members.

Examples of services that this inventory aims to include:

* **Rebate programs**, such as the [Rainwater Harvesting Rebate](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Water/Conservation/Rebates_and_Programs/Rainwater_Harvesting_Rebate_Guidelines_and_Application.pdf) \(Austin Water\).
* **Registrations or applications**, such as the [Driver Safety Request](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Municipal_Court/DeferredDisposition_Driver_Safety_Course.pdf) \(Municipal Court\) and [ordering a birth/death certificate](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Health/VitalRecords/OVR_Walkin_App_English4-16.pdf) \(Austin Public Health\). 
* **Reporting documents**, such as the [Motor Vehicle Accident Report](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Transportation/Parking/Accident_Rpt.pdf) \(Austin Transportation\).

The following activities will be **out of scope** for this inventory:

* **Internal business processes or systems** that the Austin community does not interact with -- even though they may support community-facing services. Ex: asset management systems, internal reporting workflows, or employee programs.
* **Outreach, awareness, or community engagement activities** that do not involve an explicit transaction of information or a form. Ex: 3-1-1.

**Connection to the SD23 Catalog of Work**: This service inventory is a separate but related effort to the SD23 Catalog of Work -- which the Office of Performance Management has asked departments to update for SD23 planning. Although these inventories are collecting different information, Departments may consider coordinating this information gathering with their SD23 Strategic Alignment Managers.

**Information CTM is requesting from departments**: Three overarching categories: 

1\) The impact of service on the community

* Transaction volume
* How critical the service is for its users
* Alignment with SD23 indicators
* Practices for equitable outcomes
* Fees or revenue generated

2\) How community members currently access and use the service 

* Channels offered for accessing the service 
* Compliance with accessibility standards
* Readability and translation of content
* Payment methods offered

3\) The delivery and complexity of the service

* Internal and external partners involved
* Contractual, funding, or legal requirements
* Technological requirements
* Department’s priority level for digitizing the service

**Who should fill out the questionnaire**: CTM will reach out to the Net PIO network to coordinate this information \(and will identify other staff for any departments not represented on that list\). Staff may need to involve others knowledgeable about your services, including program managers, business analysts, or IT/data points of contact. 

**What departments can expect during this process:** 

**1. Receive an email with a link to submit information for five \(5\) of your department’s priority community services \(late Oct 2019\)**. CTM will email the PIOs in each department with more details, including a questionnaire to complete for five \(5\) of your department’s services that you consider high priority for bringing online or making more accessible. Completing a full inventory of services will take time, so we will plan for how to collect information on remaining services after this initial list. 

**2. Complete the questionnaire for your department’s services \(Oct-Nov 2019\).** Department PIOs may wish to coordinate with program managers, SD23 alignment managers, or business analysts to collect and submit information on your services. CTM will provide contact information should departments need any support with the questionnaire.

**3. Access resources and tools to redesign and digitize your services \(Nov 2019\)**. CTM will share information about tools, resources, and guidance available to departments to make services more accessible, inclusive, and usable. This will include:

* Internal staff workshops and consulting services 
* Information about CTM’s digital form builder
* Resources for translating services content into other languages
* Guidance on how to make digital experiences more accessible
* A bank of demographic question formats for forms and surveys
