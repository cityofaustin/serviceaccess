# Adding to the service inventory

We are collecting an inventory of community-facing services that we should consider digitizing and redesigning. This page has information for City of Austin Departments that are helping us build the inventory.

We have asked department PIOs to coordinate information for this inventory. Expect to take about four hours over the span of three weeks to complete the questionnaire for your department’s five services. 

## **Step 1. Review the questionnaire and the information we are asking for.**

### **Access the questionnaire**

We also gave each department an online spreadsheet version if you want to draft answers or fill in information for several services at the same time. Email us at [access@austintexas.gov](mailto:access@austintexas.gov) if you need the link to your department’s spreadsheet.

### **Information we are asking for**

We are asking for information to help us understand three things about our community-facing services:

1. What is the overall community impact of the service
2. How accessible is the service currently
3. How is the service currently delivered, and what factors would we need to consider in bringing it online or redesigning it

## **Step 2. Share the questionnaire with your department and pick five \(5\) services your department would like to redesign or bring online.**

The PIOs may need to involve others knowledgeable about your services, including program managers, business analysts, or IT/data points of contact. 

### **Picking services to include in the inventory**

We want to collect information on services that meet these criteria:

1. **Transactional:** the service involves the exchange of goods, services, or information between a community member and the City government
2. **Form-based:** the service collects information through a template or application, such as those currently based on paper or PDF. 
3. **Community-facing:** the service involves direct interaction with community members.

Examples of services that this inventory aims to include:

* **Registrations or applications**, such as the [Driver Safety Request](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Municipal_Court/DeferredDisposition_Driver_Safety_Course.pdf) \(Municipal Court\) or [ordering a birth/death certificate](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Health/VitalRecords/OVR_Walkin_App_English4-16.pdf) \(Austin Public Health\). 
* **Rebate programs**, such as the [Rainwater Harvesting Rebate](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Water/Conservation/Rebates_and_Programs/Rainwater_Harvesting_Rebate_Guidelines_and_Application.pdf) \(Austin Water\).
* **Reporting documents**, such as the [Motor Vehicle Accident Report](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Transportation/Parking/Accident_Rpt.pdf) \(Austin Transportation\).

### Activities that are **out of scope** for this inventory

* **Internal business processes or systems** that the Austin community does not interact with -- even though they may support community-facing services. Ex: asset management systems, internal reporting workflows, or employee programs.
* **Outreach, awareness, or community engagement** activities that do not involve an explicit transaction of information or a form. Ex: 3-1-1.

### **Connecting with the SD23 Catalog of Work**

The Office of Performance Management has asked departments to update their Catalogs of Work for SD23 planning. This service inventory is a separate but related effort to the SD23 Catalog of Work. Departments may consider coordinating this information gathering with their SD23 Strategic Alignment Managers. 

## **Step 3. Return the questionnaire with information on those services by November 26, 2019.** 

### **Drafting your responses**

The questionnaire form has a save and resume button at the bottom. [Here’s how to use it](https://help.formstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019204632-Allowing-Users-to-Save-Resume-Forms).

If you want to draft answers or fill in information for several services at the same time, you can also use an online spreadsheet format. We provided a link to the spreadsheet for each department in the original email. Contact us at [access@austintexas.gov](mailto:access@austintexas.gov) if you need the link. 

## **How we will use the information**

The information you share with us will help us identify priority services to bring online and make more accessible — in partnership with your department. 

CTM staff and leadership will have access to the information submitted. At a later date we will share a version of the inventory with other departments, and make the inventory available to the public. The questionnaire includes space for department staff to include any concerns with sharing service information with other departments and/or publicly. 

CTM will coordinate with departments to review the inventory information before sharing it with other departments or publicly.

## **After the inventory**

CTM plans to share more information on the tools and resources that departments can use to digitize their services and make them more accessible for community members. This will include resources to:  


* Translate forms and other content into languages other than English
* Design and build online forms
* Improve the business process behind the service
* Enhance the resident experience with the service
* Accept and process online payments
* Improve the readability of information about the service
* Work with accessibility standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Section 508, and the Americans with Disabilities Act
