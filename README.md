# Service Access project
Repo for a project focused on assessing services for accessibility and prioritizing services for redesign and digitization

## Project overview

This project will assess city services for accessibility and recommend priorities for redesign and digitization. 

Why we are doing this project:
- Gaps in access to City services (e.g., mobility, language access, digital literacy, banked/unbanked, expert knowledge) privilege some residents over others.
- 2017 City Audit recommended to “ensure that the City offers as many city services online as practical by developing an inventory of services that should be offered online” ([link to audit](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Auditor/Audit_Reports/Online_Access__October_2017_.pdf)).
- Modernizing basic City services is a critical step toward more advanced use of data and technology (i.e., the "smart city").
- We have a growing capability to design and deliver more human-centered services using technology, and would benefit from a more holistic framework to use in prioritizing services to redesign and digitize.
